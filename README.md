# Kaggle's Titanic competition using Neural Network model

Kaggle's [Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic) is one of the most popular competitions provided by the site. The goal is to create a model which will predict wether a person will survive after the Titanic disaster based on certain data provided in the dataset.

I created a simple Neural Network to train on Kaggle's Titanic survival prediction dataset and achieved an accuracy of 76%. I used only few columns of the dataset and also created one using existing columns. The Neural network was made with the help of Keras and it was trained for 500 epochs.
